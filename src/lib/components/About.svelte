		Beginning in 2012, I started my journey as a software developer. Front-end development has
		always been my passion since I wanted to create beautiful and intuitive user interfaces.
		Therefore, I took a my bachelor's degree in web development, and have since worked with Angular
		since 2019 and Svelte + Kit since 2021.

		To add to my skillset within web development, I have also earned a master's degree in
		Interactive Digital Media. This has given me a deeper understanding of the user experience and
		how to design for it.

		One of my biggest passions within web development is to stay up-to-date with the latest
		technologies, which is why jumped on the Svelte train as soon as I heard about it. This is why
		this portfolio is actually is built with SvelteKit.
